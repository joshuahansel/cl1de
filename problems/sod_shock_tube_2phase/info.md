This is a 2-phase problem where the classic Sod shock tube test problem is run
in each phase. For the "liquid" phase, the normal Sod shock tube configuration
is used, and in the "vapor" phase, the Sod shock tube initial conditions are
reversed. Relaxation effects are turned off so that the phases do not interact.
The 1-phase solutions should be reproduced.
