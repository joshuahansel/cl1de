123 Problem

Quantity | Left | Right
-------- | ---- | -
Density  |    1 |   1
Velocity |   -2 |   2
Pressure |  0.4 | 0.4

From [Toro2009], p. 129:
This problem features two strong rarefactions and a trivial stationary
contact discontinuity. The star-state pressure is near vacuum and can
cause difficulties for iterative methods. This problem is also useful
for assessing numerical methods applied to low-density flows.
